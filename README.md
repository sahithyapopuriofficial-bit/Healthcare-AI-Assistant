## Safety Notes

This assistant is designed for **educational purposes only**. It will never diagnose a
condition, prescribe medication, or suggest dosages. Emergency-related messages (chest pain,
difficulty breathing, stroke symptoms, heavy bleeding, suicidal thoughts, heart attack symptoms,
loss of consciousness, seizures, or poisoning) trigger an immediate recommendation to contact
emergency services.

## Future Improvements

- Add persistent database-backed chat history
- Multi-language support
- Voice input/output
- Integration with verified medical knowledge bases
- User authentication and per-user history
- Analytics dashboard for common health topics asked
